# Home_Sales
This assignment required us to take an online csv file containing information of home sales and use SparkSQL concepts learned in class to create temporary views, partition the data, cache and uncache temporary tables, and verify the creation and dissolution of the tables. Along the way we were required to answer the questions included below:

  *What is the average price for a four-bedroom house sold for each year? Round off your answer to two decimal places.
  
  *What is the average price of a home for each year it was built that has three bedrooms and three bathrooms? Round off your     answer to two decimal places.
  
  *What is the average price of a home for each year that has three bedrooms, three bathrooms, two floors, and is greater than 
   or equal to 2,000 square feet? Round off your answer to two decimal places.
  *What is the "view" rating for homes costing more than or equal to $350,000? Determine the run time for this query, and 
   round off your answer to two decimal places.
  
Unlike most of the previous assignments where I used Jupyter Notebook to work on the projects, for this assignment I used Google Colab which came in extra handy because I could not get pySpark to install properly on my computer :)
